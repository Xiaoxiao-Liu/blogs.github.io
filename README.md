# My Overseas Voluntary Experience as a Research Assistant with the Turing Scheme

Hello, my name is **Xiaoxiao Liu**, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a PhD in **Healthcare AI** at **Bournemouth University**. I am excited to share my experience of participating in an overseas voluntary traineeship, made possible through the **Turing Scheme**. As a **research assistant** at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)**, I had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research in **large language models (LLMs)** applied to healthcare. This blog will reflect on my journey, the challenges I faced, and the valuable lessons I learned along the way.

### Why I Chose to Participate in the Turing Scheme

Before embarking on my traineeship, I was motivated by the desire to expand my understanding of healthcare AI, specifically **medical dialogue systems** powered by **LLMs**. As a researcher, I recognized that many innovative advancements are occurring globally, and working abroad would give me the chance to learn from international experts. The **Turing Scheme** funding played a pivotal role in making this opportunity accessible, allowing me to gain first-hand experience in a world-class research environment while furthering my studies and career.

### Preparing for My Traineeship

Applying for this traineeship was a process that required both careful planning and determination. I spent time researching CUHK-Shenzhen and their ongoing work in the field of **AI in healthcare**. Understanding the impact of their research and the way they applied cutting-edge technology to real-world problems, I felt motivated to contribute. The Turing Scheme funding application process was straightforward, and the financial support gave me the freedom to fully immerse myself in my research without the added pressure of financial constraints.

### Settling In and Adjusting to Life in Shenzhen

Moving to a new country was initially daunting. Being away from home and adapting to a new environment was challenging, but it quickly became a rewarding experience. I was fortunate to find comfortable living arrangements, and the contrast between life in **Shenzhen** and the UK gave me new perspectives on both personal and professional levels. The cultural exchange, combined with the experience of working in a new environment, enriched my understanding of how different cultural backgrounds can influence research, especially in the context of healthcare.

### The Research Experience at CUHK-Shenzhen

My time at CUHK-Shenzhen was a deep dive into **healthcare AI research**, particularly in the area of **LLMs for medical dialogues**. I worked alongside talented researchers, contributing to the development of more efficient models, establishing benchmarks for medical applications, and exploring **knowledge distillation** techniques. One of the highlights of my experience was learning how cultural nuances affect the design and deployment of AI systems in healthcare settings. This hands-on research was invaluable in understanding the challenges and opportunities in integrating AI into real-world healthcare environments.

### Reflections and Growth

Reflecting on my traineeship, I can confidently say that this experience has been a transformative one. I have not only expanded my technical expertise in healthcare AI but also gained a deeper understanding of **intercultural collaboration** in research. It was rewarding to work with people from different backgrounds and witness how their unique perspectives shaped the research process. Through this experience, I have built a stronger foundation for my future career in **global healthcare AI**, and I now feel more confident in pursuing opportunities that involve international collaboration and innovation.

This traineeship also helped me develop essential skills such as **communication**, **problem-solving**, and **cultural sensitivity**, all of which will be crucial for my future endeavors in AI research. 

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity provided by the **Turing Scheme** and the support from **Bournemouth University** and **CUHK-Shenzhen**. I am excited to carry these experiences forward into my future work and contribute to the growth of AI in healthcare globally.
