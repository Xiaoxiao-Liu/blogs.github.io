# My Traineeship Experience: Exploring Healthcare AI at CUHK-Shenzhen

Hello! My name is **Xiaoxiao Liu**, and I am currently pursuing my PhD at **Bournemouth University**, focusing on **Large Language Models (LLMs) in Healthcare**. I am excited to share my journey with the **BU Turing Funding** and my traineeship experience at the **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)**. This blog post will provide an overview of my academic background, my expectations before the traineeship, and how this opportunity has enriched my professional and personal growth.

### About Me: A Brief Introduction

As a PhD student specializing in **Healthcare AI**, my work revolves around applying **Large Language Models** (LLMs) to medical dialogue systems. I am passionate about advancing the field of AI in healthcare, especially in improving communication between patients and healthcare providers through AI-powered systems. 

Before embarking on this traineeship, I had been working on integrating LLMs for **medical referral dialogues** and **improving model reasoning** through advanced techniques such as **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**. The opportunity to work at CUHK-Shenzhen was a chance for me to expand my knowledge, gain hands-on experience, and learn from experts in the field.

### Preparing for My Traineeship

The process of applying for the traineeship was both exciting and challenging. I knew that this opportunity would provide a unique learning experience, so I dedicated time to thoroughly researching the **Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen** and understanding the work being done there in the field of healthcare AI. I also applied for the **Turing Scheme funding**, which supported my traineeship financially and enabled me to focus entirely on my research goals.

### Settling In at CUHK-Shenzhen

Arriving in Hong Kong was a mix of emotions â€“ I was excited, yet apprehensive. Being away from home in a new environment gave me the chance to experience different cultural perspectives, which helped me develop both personally and professionally. My living arrangements were comfortable and provided me with everything I needed to focus on my traineeship. I quickly adapted to life in Hong Kong, where the blend of modernity and tradition offered a refreshing contrast to my life in the UK.

### The Working Life

At CUHK-Shenzhen, I had the opportunity to work alongside brilliant researchers and experts in healthcare AI. My tasks involved improving LLM efficiency, establishing benchmarks for medical dialogue systems, and applying techniques like **synthetic data generation** and **knowledge distillation**. I learned a lot about the intricacies of AI in healthcare, as well as how cultural differences can influence the development and application of these technologies.

The working culture in Hong Kong was collaborative, and I found it enriching to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds. These interactions broadened my understanding of how cultural nuances can affect the design and use of AI systems in healthcare settings.

### Reflections on My Experience

Throughout my traineeship, I gained new perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in **healthcare AI**. I now have a deeper understanding of how cultural diversity can shape AI development, particularly in medical applications. This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but has also given me the confidence to pursue a global career in AI, where I hope to continue exploring the intersection of technology and healthcare.

I am incredibly grateful for the chance to be a part of this project and for the support I received from both **Bournemouth University** and **CUHK-Shenzhen**. This traineeship has been a key step in my journey, and I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills I have gained to future research projects.
